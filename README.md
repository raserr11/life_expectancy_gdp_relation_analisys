# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis (2000-2014)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six nations from 2000 to 2014. The primary goal is to explore how these two variables are correlated and to identify any patterns or insights that can be drawn from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following variables:
- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Year**: The year of observation, ranging from 2000 to 2014.
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product of the country for the given year.
- **Life Expectancy**: The average life expectancy of the country's population for the given year.

## Key Questions
This project addresses the following questions:
1. **Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?**  
   Life expectancy has generally increased over time, with varying rates of improvement across different countries.

2. **Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?**  
   GDP has shown an upward trend in all six nations, reflecting overall economic growth during the period analyzed.

3. **Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?**  
   There is a strong positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, with an average correlation coefficient exceeding 0.92.

4. **What is the average life expectancy in these nations?**  
   The average life expectancy across these nations is approximately **76** years.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to illustrate trends and correlations:
- **Line plots** to show changes in GDP and life expectancy over time.
- **Scatter plots** to highlight the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Bar plots** to compare the distribution of GDP and life expectancy across countries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Numpy**: Calculations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Normalizing data.
